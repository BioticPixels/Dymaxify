## Dymaxify

Converts equirectangular TIFF maps to Dymaxion TIFF maps.

Used in the ['Dymaxion Elevation and Shoreline Map (DESM)' article](http://bioticpixels.com/articles/dymaxion "Dymaxion Elevation and Shoreline Map (DESM)").

`original/dymaxify.pl` is the original dymaxify script by Schuyler D. Erle downloaded from [http://iconocla.st/hacks/dymax/dymaxify.pl]().

`dymaxify3.pl` is the modified script. Additions include progress output, and a little tweaking.
